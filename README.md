Heart Disease Diagnosis & PreventionHeart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the  heart  disease  umbrella  include  blood  vessel  diseases,  such  as  coronary  artery disease;  heart  rhythm  problems  (arrhythmias);  and  heart  defects  you're  born  with (congenital heart defects), among others.The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.

# Heart Disease Symptoms

Heart Disease SymptomsHeart disease symptoms depend on what type of heart disease you have.

-**Atherosclerotic Disease**:The  symptoms  appear  in  your  blood  vessels.Cardiovascular disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance,  men  are  more  likely  to  have  chest  pain;  women  are  more  likely  to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.
       
-**Heart Arrhythmias**:The symptoms appear with cause of abnormal heartbeats. Your heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly.
       
-**Heart Defects**:The defects appear while birth. Less serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood.
       
-**Dilated Cardiomyopathy**:The symptoms  caused  by  weak  heart  musclecomes under this category.In early stages of cardiomyopathy, you may have no symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptomsstartappearing.
       
-**Heart Infection**:Endocarditis is an infection that affects the inner membrane that separates the chambers and valves of the heart (endocardium).

# Risk FactorsDeveloping Heart Disease

There are several risk factors for developing heart disease which might include:

-**Age& Sex**:Aging increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and weakened or thickened heart muscle.Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. However, women's risk increases after menopause.
      
-**Family  history**:A  family  history  of  heart  disease  increases  your  risk  of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age.
      
-**Smoking**:Nicotine  constricts  your  blood  vessels,  and  carbon  monoxide  can damage  their  inner  lining,  making  them  more  susceptible  to  atherosclerosis. Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in non-smokers.
      
-**Poor diet& Poor Hygiene**:A diet that's high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease.Not regularly washing your hands and not establishing other habits that can help prevent viral or bacterial infections can put you at risk of heart infections
      
-**High   blood   pressure**:Uncontrolled   high blood   pressure   can   result   in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the vessels through which blood  flows.
      
-**High blood  cholesterol  levels**:High  levels of  cholesterol  in  your  blood  can increase the risk of formation of plaques and atherosclerosis.
      
-**Diabetes**:Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease. Both conditions share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.
      
-**Obesity**:Excess weight typically worsens other risk factors.â€¢Physical  inactivity:Lack  of  exercise  also  is  associated  with  many  forms  of heart disease and some of its other risk factors, as well.
      
-**Stress**:Unrelieved  stress  may  damage  your  arteries  and  worsen  other  risk factors for heart disease.
