Heart Disease Diagnosis & PreventionHeart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the  heart  disease  umbrella  include  blood  vessel  diseases,  such  as  coronary  artery disease;  heart  rhythm  problems  (arrhythmias);  and  heart  defects  you're  born  with (congenital heart defects), among others.The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.Heart Disease SymptomsHeart disease symptoms depend on what type of heart disease you have.â€¢Atherosclerotic Disease:The  symptoms  appear  in  your  blood  vessels.Cardiovascular disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance,  men  are  more  likely  to  have  chest  pain;  women  are  more  likely  to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.
